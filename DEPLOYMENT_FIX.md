# 🔧 Deployment Fix Applied

## ✅ **Issue Fixed:**

The build was failing because of a Next.js configuration conflict:

```
[Error: Page "/decks/[deckId]/edit" is missing "generateStaticParams()" so it cannot be used with "output: export" config.]
```

## 🔧 **What Was Fixed:**

### **1. Updated `next.config.mjs`:**
- ❌ Removed `output: 'export'` (was causing static export issues)
- ❌ Removed `distDir: 'out'` (not needed for Netlify)
- ✅ Kept other optimizations

### **2. Updated `netlify.toml`:**
- ✅ Added `@netlify/plugin-nextjs` plugin
- ✅ Kept correct publish directory (`.next`)

## 🚀 **Next Steps:**

1. **Commit and push the changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix deployment: Remove static export config"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Redeploy on Netlify:**
   - The build should now succeed
   - No manual intervention needed

## 🎯 **Expected Result:**

- ✅ Build will complete successfully
- ✅ Dynamic routes will work properly
- ✅ Authentication will function correctly
- ✅ All features will be available

## 🔧 **Why This Fix Works:**

- **Static Export**: Was trying to pre-generate all pages at build time
- **Dynamic Routes**: Need server-side rendering for dynamic content
- **Netlify Plugin**: Handles Next.js server-side features properly

**The deployment should now work! 🚀**
